# Preface {.unnumbered}


Welcome to MA42002 Mathematical Biology I.

My name is Philip Murray and I am the module lead.

## How to contact me?

* email: pmurray@dundee.ac.uk
* office: G11, Fulton Building


## Lecture notes
You can find  lecture notes for the module on this page. If you would like a pdf this can be easily generated by clicking on the pdf link on the top left of the webpages. I will occasionally edit/update the notes  we proceed through lectures. If you spot any errors, typos or omissions please let me know.

## Python codes

I have provided Python codes for most of the figures in the notes (you can unfold code section by clicking `Code'). Note that the Python code does not appear in the pdf.

 Many of you have taken the Introduction to Programming module at Level 2 and have therefore some experience using Python. I strongly encourage you to use the provided codes as a tool to play around with numerical solutions of the various models that we will be working on. The codes should run as standalone Python codes.

 I have also provided some examples of how to use Python as a symbolic calculator. This uses a Python library called *sympy* and is quite similar to Maple. 

## Assessment
 
* Final exam (80 \%)

* 2 class tests (8.5 \% each), Week 6 and 10

* 3 quizes (1 \% each), Week 2,4 and 8
