## 

In the module we will be required to graph of nonlinear function.

Consider a nonlinear function 
$$
f(x;p), \quad x \in \Re.
$$
where $p$ is a constant.


For example, 
$$
f(x)=rx(1-x), \quad x \in \Re.
$$

Our goal is usually to sketch $f$ in qualitatively distinct cases. For example: the graph of $f$ when $r=1$ is *qualitatively* equivelent to the graph of $f$ when $r=2$. However, when $r=-1$ it is qualitatively distinct.

The challenge is to firstly identify qualitatively distinct cases. Then sketch $f$ for each of these cases.

T0 identify qualitatively distinct cases we test the properties of $f$ as follows:

1. Identify the *biologically relevant* roots of f. 
    We define $x^*$ such that
    $$ 
    f(x^*;p)=0.
    $$
    Biologically relevant solutions require $x^*\geq0$.

    Does the number of biologically relevant solutions depend on the parameter $p$?

2. Identify the turning points of f.    
   Differentiate $f$ with respect to $x$. Identify turning points, $x_c$, such that
   $$
        \frac{df}{dx}\bigg|_{x=x_c}=0.
   $$ 
   Are there any turning points?
   Are they biologically relevant?
   Does the number of biologically relevant solutions depend on the parameter $p$?

3. Identify limiting behaviour as $x\rightarrow \infty$. Compute the limit
$$
 \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}f(x;p)=0.
$$
